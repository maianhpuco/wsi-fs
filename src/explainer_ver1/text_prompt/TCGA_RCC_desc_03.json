  "Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC)": [
    "ccRCC  Clear Cytoplasm  Tumor cells exhibit abundant clear cytoplasm due to glycogen and lipid content being dissolved during processing. This gives the cells a 'clear' appearance under H&E staining.",
    "ccRCC  Delicate Vasculature  Numerous fine, arborizing capillaries create a 'chicken wire' or 'lace-like' vascular pattern between nests of tumor cells.",
    "ccRCC  Cell Arrangement  Cells are arranged in nests, acini, or alveolar patterns surrounded by the aforementioned vasculature.",
    "ccRCC  Nuclear Grade  Typically low to intermediate Fuhrman or ISUP nuclear grade; nuclei are round with smooth contours and inconspicuous nucleoli (Grade 1â€“2), but can be higher in aggressive forms.",
    "ccRCC  Necrosis and Hemorrhage  In more aggressive or larger tumors, areas of necrosis, hemorrhage, or cystic degeneration may be visible.",
    "ccRCC  Cystic Changes  Focal cystic spaces filled with fluid can occur within the tumor architecture.",
    "ccRCC  Thick-walled Vessels  Prominent, thick-walled vessels may be seen traversing the tumor.",
    "ccRCC  Pseudocapsule  A fibrous pseudocapsule often separates the tumor from adjacent renal parenchyma.",
    "ccRCC  Sinusoidal Network  Rich sinusoidal spaces are commonly seen between tumor cell nests.",
    "ccRCC  High Lipid Content  Lipid-laden cytoplasm is often retained in fresh frozen sections but appears clear in routine H&E stains."
  ],
  "Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma (pRCC)": [
    "pRCC  Papillary Architecture  Tumor is composed of papillae with central fibrovascular cores lined by tumor cells.",
    "pRCC  Foamy Macrophages  The papillary cores are frequently infiltrated by foamy (lipid-laden) macrophages.",
    "pRCC  Psammoma Bodies  Small, concentrically laminated calcified structures may be seen within the papillae.",
    "pRCC  Tubulopapillary Pattern  Areas of tubular structures alongside papillary formations can be present.",
    "pRCC  Cytoplasmic Color  Tumor cells display basophilic cytoplasm in Type 1 and eosinophilic cytoplasm in Type 2 pRCC.",
    "pRCC  Nuclei Shape  The nuclei are oval to elongated and less pleomorphic than in clear cell RCC.",
    "pRCC  Multifocality  Tumors may present as multiple nodules within the same kidney.",
    "pRCC  Fibrous Capsule  A thick fibrous capsule often encloses tumor clusters.",
    "pRCC  Hemosiderin Pigment  Brown pigment accumulation due to iron (hemosiderin) may be seen in macrophages or tumor cells.",
    "pRCC  Tumor-Normal Interface  A sharp boundary typically separates tumor tissue from adjacent normal renal parenchyma."
  ],
  "Chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma (chRCC)": [
    "chRCC  Pale Eosinophilic Cytoplasm  Tumor cells display a pale to eosinophilic cytoplasm that appears granular and translucent under H&E staining due to numerous cytoplasmic vesicles.",
    "chRCC  Perinuclear Halos  Distinct clear zones surrounding the nuclei are seen in most tumor cells, forming characteristic perinuclear halos caused by cytoplasmic clearing.",
    "chRCC  Wrinkled Nuclei  The nuclei often exhibit irregular, wrinkled, or raisinoid contours, which help distinguish chRCC from other renal tumors.",
    "chRCC  Well-defined Cell Borders  Tumor cells have distinct and prominent cell borders, resulting in a plant-cell or cobblestone-like appearance.",
    "chRCC  Binucleation  It is common to observe binucleated cells, where individual tumor cells contain two nuclei of similar size and shape.",
    "chRCC  Solid and Trabecular Architecture  Tumor cells are usually arranged in solid sheets or trabecular (cord-like) formations, without significant papillary or nested structures.",
    "chRCC  Fibrotic Stroma  The background stroma is often fibrotic and hyalinized, sometimes with thick-walled blood vessels coursing through it.",
    "chRCC  Low Mitotic Activity  chRCC typically shows minimal mitotic activity and nuclear pleomorphism, contributing to its generally indolent behavior.",
    "chRCC  Hyaline Degeneration  Focal areas of stromal or cytoplasmic hyaline change can be seen, appearing as homogenous, glassy eosinophilic material.",
    "chRCC  Sharp Tumor Margins  Tumor boundaries are often well-circumscribed, showing a sharp demarcation from the adjacent renal parenchyma."
