  "Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC)": [
    "ccRCC  Clear cytoplasm is the hallmark of this tumor, caused by dissolved lipids and glycogen.",
    "ccRCC  A rich, delicate capillary network creates a chicken-wire appearance between tumor nests.",
    "ccRCC  Tumor cells are organized in nested or alveolar architectures with sinusoidal spaces.",
    "ccRCC  Low to intermediate-grade nuclei with round contours and small nucleoli are common in ccRCC.",
    "ccRCC  ccRCC often shows areas of hemorrhage and cystic degeneration within the tumor mass.",
    "ccRCC  This tumor lacks papillary structures with fibrovascular cores, which are common in pRCC.",
    "ccRCC  Unlike chRCC, ccRCC does not have perinuclear halos or a plant-cell appearance.",
    "ccRCC  ccRCC is not characterized by eosinophilic cytoplasm or wrinkled nuclei.",
    "ccRCC  You won't find foamy macrophages or psammoma bodies in classic ccRCC morphology.",
    "ccRCC  ccRCC does not display solid sheet-like or trabecular growth typical of chRCC."
  ], 
  "Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma (pRCC)": [
    "pRCC  Tumor growth is papillary with central fibrovascular cores lined by epithelial cells.",
    "pRCC  Foamy macrophages are abundant in the papillary cores, forming a key diagnostic feature.",
    "pRCC  Psammoma bodies, or concentrically laminated calcifications, are commonly seen.",
    "pRCC  The tumor often presents as multiple discrete nodules (multifocality) within the kidney.",
    "pRCC  Cells may show basophilic (Type 1) or eosinophilic (Type 2) cytoplasm depending on subtype.",
    "pRCC  pRCC does not exhibit the clear cytoplasm seen in ccRCC due to lack of lipid/glycogen clearing.",
    "pRCC  Unlike chRCC, it lacks well-defined cell borders and perinuclear halos.",
    "pRCC  pRCC is not arranged in solid trabecular sheets like chromophobe RCC.",
    "pRCC  There is no prominent sinusoidal vascular pattern as found in ccRCC.",
    "pRCC  The nuclei in pRCC are typically not wrinkled or raisinoid, unlike in chRCC."
  ], 
  "Chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma (chRCC)": [
    "chRCC  Tumor cells have pale eosinophilic cytoplasm filled with microvesicles under H&E staining.",
    "chRCC  Perinuclear halos are a defining cytologic feature, creating a clearing zone around nuclei.",
    "chRCC  The nuclei appear wrinkled and irregular â€” often described as raisinoid.",
    "chRCC  chRCC forms solid sheets or trabecular cords of cells with minimal architectural complexity.",
    "chRCC  Tumor cells display well-defined cell membranes, giving a plant-cell or cobblestone appearance.",
    "chRCC  chRCC does not contain clear cytoplasm or lipid-rich vacuoles like ccRCC.",
    "chRCC  Papillary architecture and foamy macrophages are not features of chRCC.",
    "chRCC  This tumor lacks sinusoidal capillary networks seen in ccRCC.",
    "chRCC  Unlike pRCC, chRCC does not form fibrovascular papillae or psammoma bodies.",
    "chRCC  Nuclei in chRCC are not round and smooth; they are irregular and wrinkled, unlike in ccRCC or pRCC."
  ], 
  "No Tumor Detected": [
    "Normal renal parenchyma with no visible tumor cells.",
    "Benign glomeruli and tubules without nuclear atypia.",
    "Absence of papillary, clear cell, or chromophobe features."
