  "Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC)": [
    "ccRCC  Clear cytoplasm is the hallmark of this tumor, caused by dissolved lipids and glycogen.",
    "ccRCC  A rich, delicate capillary network creates a chicken-wire appearance between tumor nests.",
    "ccRCC  Tumor cells are organized in nested or alveolar architectures with sinusoidal spaces.",
    "ccRCC  Low to intermediate-grade nuclei with round contours and small nucleoli are common in ccRCC.",
    "ccRCC  ccRCC often shows areas of hemorrhage and cystic degeneration within the tumor mass.",
    "ccRCC  This tumor lacks papillary structures with fibrovascular cores, which are common in pRCC.",
    "ccRCC  Unlike chRCC, ccRCC does not have perinuclear halos or a plant-cell appearance.",
    "ccRCC  ccRCC is not characterized by eosinophilic cytoplasm or wrinkled nuclei.",
    "ccRCC  You won't find foamy macrophages or psammoma bodies in classic ccRCC morphology.",
    "ccRCC  ccRCC does not display solid sheet-like or trabecular growth typical of chRCC."
  ], 
  "Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma (pRCC)": [
    "pRCC  Tumor growth is papillary with central fibrovascular cores lined by epithelial cells.",
    "pRCC  Foamy macrophages are abundant in the papillary cores, forming a key diagnostic feature.",
    "pRCC  Psammoma bodies, or concentrically laminated calcifications, are commonly seen.",
    "pRCC  The tumor often presents as multiple discrete nodules (multifocality) within the kidney.",
    "pRCC  Cells may show basophilic (Type 1) or eosinophilic (Type 2) cytoplasm depending on subtype.",
    "pRCC  pRCC does not exhibit the clear cytoplasm seen in ccRCC due to lack of lipid/glycogen clearing.",
    "pRCC  Unlike chRCC, it lacks well-defined cell borders and perinuclear halos.",
    "pRCC  pRCC is not arranged in solid trabecular sheets like chromophobe RCC.",
    "pRCC  There is no prominent sinusoidal vascular pattern as found in ccRCC.",
    "pRCC  The nuclei in pRCC are typically not wrinkled or raisinoid, unlike in chRCC."
  ], 
  "Chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma (chRCC)": [
    "chRCC  Tumor cells in chromophobe RCC display pale eosinophilic cytoplasm with a translucent quality caused by cytoplasmic microvesicles.",
    "chRCC  One of the most defining features of chRCC is the presence of prominent perinuclear halos, forming a clear ring around the nucleus.",
    "chRCC  chRCC nuclei are irregular, wrinkled, and raisinoid in shape, contrasting sharply with the smooth nuclei seen in ccRCC.",
    "chRCC  Tumor cells grow in solid sheets or trabecular patterns, lacking the papillary or nested arrangement of other RCC subtypes.",
    "chRCC  The tumor shows sharply defined cell borders, creating a plant-cell-like appearance under the microscope.",
    "chRCC  Chromophobe RCC does not contain clear cytoplasm or chicken-wire vasculature, which are characteristic of clear cell RCC.",
    "chRCC  This tumor lacks papillary architecture and does not have fibrovascular cores or foamy macrophages like pRCC.",
    "chRCC  chRCC is not composed of alveolar or nested structures and does not exhibit sinusoidal networks like ccRCC.",
    "chRCC  The cytoplasm in chRCC is not clear or lipid-rich; instead, it is pale and granular with perinuclear clearing.",
    "chRCC  Unlike pRCC or ccRCC, chRCC rarely exhibits hemorrhage, cystic changes, or psammoma bodies."
